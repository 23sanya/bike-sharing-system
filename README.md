# Bike Sharing Rental System
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Objectives
Identified and removed redundant and unnecessary columns from the ‘day’ data set (Bike share data set) 
• Performed data cleaning on ‘day’ data sets to remove the junk data (Columns having 100% null values and rows where the entire row is having null values) and the data which is not required for analysis 
• Analyzed the variables and their different data types, also performed null value checks for the variables. Data Cleaning and Manipulation • Data quality issues are addressed in the right way (missing value imputation, outlier treatment and other kinds of data redundancies 
• Wherever applicable, data is converted to a suitable and convenient format to work with using the right methods for e.g. categorical variables converted into dummy variables in order build the model. 
• Splitting into train and test sets is done • Rescaling is done to optimize the beta coefficients
